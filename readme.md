# Exercise Instructions


## Goal: To create an event listener that will print out the text content of a button when clicked.

Consider the difference between an element and a node; is the text content of a button an element or a node?

1. Clone this repo.

2. You have been provided with some starter code. Take a look at the inline code comments in `script.js` for information on where exactly you should write your code.  

- When you are writing the code to attach an event listener, you will want to use `$(this)` to refer to the object you are attaching an event listener to.

## Hint:

You may need to look up a few helpful methods to use along with `$(this)` in the [jQuery docs](http://api.jquery.com/)... Some methods to keep an eye out for are listed below, but bear in mind that one might be best suited for the exercise.

- `.html()`
- `.text()`
- `.contents()`
