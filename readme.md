Using `this`, create an event listener that will print out the text content of a button (e.g., `I am the first button`) to the console when clicked. You have been provided with some starter code. Take a look at the inline code comments in `script.js` for information on where exactly you should write your code.  

Things you may need to look up...
* `.innerText`
* `.querySelectorAll`
